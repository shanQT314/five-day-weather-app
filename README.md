# Technical Assessment
## Take home task


## Objective
Build a functioning Weather app using the Open Weather API
The app should provide two basic functionalities:
* Search for a 5-day weather forecast of a specific city and display the results.
* Display more details about the weather forecast of one of the days returned on the search when clicking on it

## Final Product

The final product is a React application that uses the Open Weather API (obviously) as well as Bootstrap.

## Instructions

To build and run the application, just ensure that you have the latest npm build installed and run the following:

`npm install`
`npm start`

For ease of access, I've opted to include my API Key (which will be disabled temporarily) so that you fine people can run the code easily without having to obtain your own. Naturally, this would be in a separate config file that's not shared.

Thank you very much!
