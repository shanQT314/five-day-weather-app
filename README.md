# Technical Assessment
## Take home task
### Ahmad Shanqiti


## Objective
Build a functioning Weather app using the Open Weather API
The app should provide two basic functionalities:
* Search for a 5-day weather forecast of a specific city and display the results.
* Display more details about the weather forecast of one of the days returned on the search when clicking on it

## Final Product

The final product is a React application that uses the Open Weather API (obviously) as well as Bootstrap.

## Instructions

To build and run the application, just ensure that you have the latest npm build installed and run the following:

### `npm install`
### `npm start`

For ease of access, I've opted to include my API Key so that you fine people can run the code easily without having to obtain your own. Naturally, this would be in a separate config file that's not shared.

I commend you guys on the choice of take home assessment, as this was quite fun and enjoyable and gave me quite a bit of leeway in how I wanted to design it, in the end I chose the simplest way. I know what I could've done to improve on the design, but I'm looking forward to hearing your opinions as well.

Thank you very much!
